## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 6
This lab was my favorite because it allowed me to apply what I had been learning so far into a real life scenario. In part 1 of this lab I had to create a code that allowed the user to essentially build their own sandwich by typing in the ingredients they would like on it. Part 2 of lab 6 solidified it as my favorite because we created blackjack in code. I always thought that creating a game would be really difficult and this lab showed that it can be something extremely simple.

* Lab 8
This lab was second because it kept the theme of using code in real world scenarios. In this case, part 1 of the lab made us develop a code that allowed the user to input their ingredients for their sandwich but this time we had to use an if statement that would provide an error message if the conditions werenâ€™t met. Part 2 made us develop a function to calculate the average of however many numbers were given.

* Lab 11
Lab 11 was by far the hardest and most complex of the labs up until that point. Part 1 made us create a code that helped to find the pizza with the highest and the lowest price-per-2000 calories.Seeing that we could create a code that will sort all the different types of pizza to find the most expensive and cheapest pizza in an instant was very interesting. Part 2 was creating a guessing game. Creating a game that we could play with our lab partner was a very fun experience.
